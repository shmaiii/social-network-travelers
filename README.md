# social-network-travelers

## Intro
A Twitter-like social network website for avid travelers to create posts & blogs about their travel experiences. This would be the platform for anyone to get tips
on traveling, share stories about their trips. No need to have tonnes of tabs when planning your trip as everything will be right here at one page!

Skills include Python and Django framework as backend, data is stored in sqlite3 file, and HTML, CSS, and Javascript as front-end. Worked with JSon API to fetch data from server to client-side with Javascript. Applied Django's Paginator class to implement Pagination. 

## User Story
As a user I want to: 
- Create new posts/ status for everyone to see
- View all posts, or posts by specific users who I follow
- View users' profiles including their infos (followers, following), and their posts. Be able to follow/unfollow them
- Edit my posts 
- Like/Unlike other users' posts.
