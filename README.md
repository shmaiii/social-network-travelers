# social-network-travelers

## Intro
A Twitter-like social network website for avid travelers to create posts, follow each other, etc to get connected. This would be the platform for anyone to get tips
on traveling, share stories about their trips, or just get to know other travellers.

Skills include Python and Django framework as backend, data is stored in sqlite3 file, and HTML, CSS, and Javascript as front-end. Worked with JSon API to fetch data from server to client-side with Javascript. Applied Django's Paginator class to implement Pagination. Currently in progress of implementing 
key features for this web app and then apply React.js as practice to enhance this library. 

## User Story
As a user I want to: 
- Create new posts/ status for everyone to see
- View all posts, or posts by specific users who I follow
- View users' profiles including their infos (followers, following), and their posts. Be able to follow/unfollow them
- Edit my posts 
- Like/Unlike other users' posts. 
- Add comments to any posts and view existing comments.
- Search posts according to locations. (If I want to search Greece, I should see all the posts with content relevant to Greece).

Half of user stories currently done, on my way to implement the other half and web styling.
